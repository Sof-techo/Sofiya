            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This website serves as promotional media for the Ethiopian restaurant located in the heart of the city of Leuven. The restaurant has been in business for the last five years, but it has not increased revenue in the last three years. It needs to attract new customers to increase its market share. With most target customers being tourists, the website needs to be user-friendly and appealing to viewers.</p>
